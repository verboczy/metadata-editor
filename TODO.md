# TODOs
This file contains the tasks that need to be done. 
This is needed, because after a task is complete, it introduces a couple more tasks. 
Somehow I need to track these tasks, and this todo file seemed to be the most trivial solution for this.

## Functionality
+ Search by metadata
  + Planning is needed first.
+ Add some styling to the app.
  + Coloring.
  + Details should be a heading.
  + Consider the app's size (width, height).
+ Make it runnable from a single jar file.

## Development
+ Reconsider structure of code.
+ Add validation to buttons, e.g. disable the button if it shouldn't be pressed. 
+ Change system out commands to log calls.
+ Introduce own exceptions and handle them.
+ Write tests.

## Others
+ Put the code into GitHub repository.
  + Write a readme.md.
  + Use GitHub's Issues feature instead of this TODO file.
+ Write docs for the program.
